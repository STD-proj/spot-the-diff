### About the project

Spot the Difference is a well-known and popular game, the player's mission is to find the differences between two pictures.
Currently, the game is traditionally created by a graphic designer or anyone who knows how to use graphic software, and it should be prepared in advance.

We met CloseApp company that basically wants to increase its game variety by adding automated games, with no need to prepare things before playing.
Our project should definitely meet their needs.
