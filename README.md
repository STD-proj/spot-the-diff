# Spot the Difference
### Final project 

Developed by @sheindyfr and @ayalabarazani

The project has developed as a final project of our Software Enginnering studies

### About the project

Spot the difference is a well known and popular game, the mission of the player is to find the difference between 2 images.
currently, the game is created by a graphic designer or anybody who knows to use graphic software, and it has to be ready in advance.

We met CloseApp company who wants to increase its game variance by adding automated games, with no need to prepare things before playing.
Our project should definitely fill their needs.
